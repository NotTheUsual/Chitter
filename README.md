# Chitter

Chitter is an exercise in creating a service that allows users to sign up and post short messages to a public feed.

Any resemblance to any existing service is entirely coincidental, I'm sure

## Makers

Makers can sign in via the button in the top right. Subsequently, they are free to sign in or sign out as they please.

## Peeps

Signed in Makers can create peeps. All peeps are posted to a chronological public feed. Anyone can click on the link in the date of a peep to see it in more detail. If signed in, they can then create replies. Any direct replies are lsited below the peep (if those replies have replies, a link to view more is provided instead). If the peep you're viewing is itself a reply, the peep it is a reply to appears above.
